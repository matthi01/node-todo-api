<p><b>node-todo-api</b></p>

<p>Using node and MongoDB and Mongoose to create an API for a ToDo app.</p>

<p>New to MongoDB and Mongoose so I used the playground folder to get more familiar
with some of the commands. Keeping that there for reference.</p>

<p>This repository also contains Mocha unit test scripts for all functionality of the API. You can run these tests with a custom
script using nodemon 'npm run test-watch'.</p>
